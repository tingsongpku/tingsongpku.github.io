        <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>I have board interests in Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Information Retrieval and Machine Learning. </p>

            <p>My main work during my PhD program is studying knowledge mining from text streams. Even though most information is produced in a text stream, there is little work on mining knowledge given the stream context. In fact, by considering the stream context, many knowledge discovery mechanism can be applied (e.g., measuring information importance, analyzing evolutionary patterns and discovering links between text mentions)</p>

            <p>To address the challenges of stream knowledge mining, I propose a novel text stream representation -- <i>Burst Information Networks (BINets)</i>, which is an information network based on word bursts. The BINets are proven to be effectively on stream summarization, stream alignment and stream evoluationary pattern mining.
        
        <p> In addition, I also study some interesting topics like general event knowledge acquisition for event KB construction and Chinese temporal analysis. Specially, for Chinese temporal analysis, I created a benchmark dataset (<a href="data/ChineseTenseData.zip">link</a>) for tense prediction in Chinese conversations. The dataset contains 294 conversations including 1,857 sentences, which is collected from 25 Chinese movies, dramas and TV shows. Please cite this paper if you use this data for your research:
